**CSE-3302**

This repo contains the Labs developed for CSE 3302 (Programming Languages) with Kelly Scott French at UTA.

Lab 1- Directory Size:
    Write a program to calculate the total size (in bytes, no text or commas, just the integer answer) of all files in the current directory / folder and all sub-folders. Must include a recursive function i.e. no os.walk in Python :(
